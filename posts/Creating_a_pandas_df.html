        <h1>Creating a Pandas DataFrame</h1>
<p>Pandas are one of the most popular libraries for Data Mining and Data Storage, offering fast manipulation and selection retrieval, Pandas have quickly become a favourite in the Machine Learning community. Pandas large suite of methods and classes provide easy-to-use aggregation, analysis, and visualization tools. This article is the first in a series that focuses on all the fabulous functionality Pandas have to offer!</p>
<p>On a day to day basis, I use the python library pandas in order to preform many different data mining tasks.  Pandas is a wonderful library that a wide range of functionality, from operating similarly to a relational database to visualizing data driven results, the Pandas library allows for efficient data manipulation at scale in python.</p>
<p>The fundamental Object in the pandas library is <code>DataFrame</code>. As the name suggests, this class holds are data in a framework (or table) and has many methods for interacting with the dataset. A DataFrame, simply put, is a list columns with rows containing data entries for each column. For example say we are collecting temperature and pressure measurements in the Pacific Ocean. We want to know the temperature, pressure, location (longitude, latitude, and altitude), and the time the measurement was taken. So we have six column headers; temperature, pressure, longitude, latitude, altitude, and time. Suppose we survey 5 locations in the Pacific, then there is 5 rows in table of collected data. That is,</p>
<p><table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>temperature</th>
      <th>pressure</th>
      <th>longitude</th>
      <th>latitude</th>
      <th>altitude</th>
      <th>time</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>55.5</td>
      <td>1021</td>
      <td>-140</td>
      <td>46</td>
      <td>-100</td>
      <td>07:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>56.5</td>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>-180</td>
      <td>46</td>
      <td>-101</td>
      <td>10:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>55.8</td>
      <td>1022</td>
      <td>-140</td>
      <td>56</td>
      <td>-97</td>
      <td>12:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>54.5</td>
      <td>1020</td>
      <td>-180</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>-102</td>
      <td>18:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>57.5</td>
      <td>1025</td>
      <td>-140</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>-99</td>
      <td>20:00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table></p>
<p><em>The units for temperature are Fahrenheit, kilo-Pascals for pressure, and meters below sea level for altitude. Note the data in the above table is made up whole cloth. We leave is as an exercise for the interested physics student to identify the inconsistencies. For instance, how fast would the boat have to travel in order to arrive at each location and carry out the measurements at the stated times? Or was the path taken by the surveyor's the most time efficient for the locations they visited?</em></p>
<h2>Installing Pandas</h2>
<p>To install the pandas library, use the pip package manager and type the following into your terminal</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install pandas
</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<h2>Import Pandas</h2>
<p>Like many popular python libraries it is common practice to import pandas with the alias pd.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd
</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<h2>Reading Data into a Dataframe</h2>
<p>The easiest way to read data into a DataFrame is to use <code>pd.read_csv()</code> which as the name suggests reads in data from a comma separated value file (like an excel table). Here is a short list of some methods to read data into a DataFrame, and below we give examples with our temperature data on how to use them.</p>
<h4>Read from csv</h4>
<p>A csv (or comma separated value) file that contains our temperature example can be <a href="https://joehowie.ca/example_scripts/temperature_data.csv">downloaded here.</a> With the data downloaded, you can now load it into a pandas DataFrame running the following python code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

column_names = [&quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;pressure&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;, &quot;altitude&quot;, &quot;time&quot;] # column names, as they are not in the file itself
df = pd.read_csv(&quot;temperature_data.csv&quot;, names=column_names) # load data with the column names passed in
print(df)
</code></pre>
<p> 
See the docs page for more details on using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html"><code>pd.read_csv()</code>.</a></p>
<h4>Read from html</h4>
<p>Given that most of the world wide web consists of html pages, you are bound to run into to these table soon or later. We have prepared the temperature example data in a html format <a href="https://joehowie.ca/example_scripts/temperature_data.pkl">downloadable here.</a>. Now that the data has been downloaded the following code can be executed to read the table into a pandas DataFrame.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

# Read the HTML file and obtain a list of DataFrame objects
dataframes = pd.read_html(&quot;temperature_data.html&quot;)
# Access the desired DataFrame object (assuming it's the first one)
df = dataframes[0]
# Specify the column names
df.columns = column_names
print(df)
</code></pre>
<p> 
See the docs page for more details on <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_html.html"><code>pd.read_html()</code>.</a></p>
<h4>Read from pickle</h4>
<p>Pickle is a python module for serializing data structures like dictionary or array data. If you have data stored as a python dictionary, you may save that data to a pickle file for later use in a separate program. The temperature data has been serialized using the python pickler (which is fun to say five times fast) and can be <a href="https://joehowie.ca/example_scripts/temperature_data.pkl">downloaded from this link.</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

# Read the pickle file into a the stored form, in this case a 2d array
df = pd.read_pickle('temperature_data.pkl')

# Create a DataFrame from the 2D array
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=column_names)
print(df)
</code></pre>
<p> 
See the docs page for more details on <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_pickle.html"><code>pd.read_pickle()</code>.</a></p>
<p>All three code snippets will print the following result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">temperature  pressure  longitude  latitude  altitude   time
0         55.5      1021       -140        46      -100  07:00
1         56.5      1024       -180        46      -101  10:00
2         55.8      1022       -140        56       -97  12:00
3         54.5      1020       -180        36      -102  18:00
4         57.5      1025       -140        36       -99  20:00
</code></pre>
<p> 
There are many more other file types, so take a look at <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/">the docs</a> for more on these methods. Below we give examples for importing data using the three methods above.</p>
<h2>Building a DataFrame from Scratch</h2>
<p>If you have your data already in a python script; because it is generated in your code; or stored as a series of lists; or in a python dictionary; then you can add it to a DataFrame directly by calling the object.</p>
<p>Using our example from above, suppose that we have six python list each with the measurements for the six columns. That is, the index of each list correspond to the row indices of the DataFrame we wish to build.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

## data as a python list
temp  = [55.5, 56.5, 55.8, 54.5, 57.5]
pres  = [1021, 1024, 1022, 1020, 1025]
longi = [-140, -180, -140, -180, -140]
lati  = [46, 46, 56, 36, 36]
alti  = [-100, -101, -97, -102, -99]
time  = [&quot;07:00&quot;, &quot;10:00&quot;, &quot;12:00&quot;, &quot;18:00&quot;, &quot;20:00&quot;]

## make a dictionary with keys the column names
data = {&quot;temperature&quot;: temp,
        &quot;pressure&quot;: pres,
        &quot;longitude&quot;: longi,
        &quot;latitude&quot;: lati,
        &quot;altitude&quot;: alti,
        &quot;time&quot;: time}

## create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

## print table to terminal
print(df)
</code></pre>
<p> 
Alternatively, the data could have been stored as a 2d array, which can be converted to a DataFrame also,
 </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

data = [
    [55.5, 1021, -140, 46, -100, &quot;07:00&quot;],
    [56.5, 1024, -180, 46, -101, &quot;10:00&quot;],
    [55.8, 1022, -140, 56, -97, &quot;12:00&quot;],
    [54.5, 1020, -180, 36, -102, &quot;18:00&quot;],
    [57.5, 1025, -140, 36, -99, &quot;20:00&quot;]
]

# Column names
column_names = [&quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;pressure&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;, &quot;altitude&quot;, &quot;time&quot;]

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=column_names)
print(df)
</code></pre>
<p> 
Both of these code snippets print the same table as did the read methods above.</p>
<h2>Adding data to a Dataframe</h2>
<p>Once you have a DataFrame like in the above code blocks, you can add rows using <code>pd.concat()</code>. Here is an example of how to add one additional row,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

column_names = [&quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;pressure&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;, &quot;altitude&quot;, &quot;time&quot;] # column names, as they are not in the file itself
df = pd.read_csv(&quot;temperature_data.csv&quot;, names=column_names) # load data with the column names passed in

### Adding rows one at a times
new_row_entry = [[55.1, 1021, -150, 40, -102, &quot;22:00&quot;]]

# we use the class variable `columns` to get the names of the columns in df.
new_row = pd.DataFrame(new_row_entry, columns=df.columns)#list(data.keys()))

# appedn the new row to the bottom
df = pd.concat([df, new_row], ignore_index=True)
print(df)
</code></pre>
<p> 
which outputs,</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">temperature  pressure  longitude  latitude  altitude   time
0         55.5      1021       -140        46      -100  07:00
1         56.5      1024       -180        46      -101  10:00
2         55.8      1022       -140        56       -97  12:00
3         54.5      1020       -180        36      -102  18:00
4         57.5      1025       -140        36       -99  20:00
5         55.1      1021       -150        40      -102  22:00
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we make a new DataFrame with the same columns as the original and add only the one row, then with <code>pd.concat()</code> we combine them to create a DataFrame that has the rows of the first followed by the second. Hence, we are not limited to adding one row at a time, we may simply make a new DataFrame with the additional rows and then use <code>pd.concat()</code> to append the new rows. Important note, there is a pandas method called <code>pd.append()</code>, but this method is deprecated and should not be used in future projects.</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>Up to this point we have seen several methods for building a DataFrame (by loading data from a file and constructing it in code). We learned how to read data from a csv, html, or pickle file; we also saw how to build a DataFrame from scratch in a python script. In the next article we cover selecting subsets of rows in a DataFrame.</p>
